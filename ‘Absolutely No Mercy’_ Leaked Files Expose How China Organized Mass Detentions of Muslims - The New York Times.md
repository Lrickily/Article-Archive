**HONG KONG —** The students booked their tickets home at the end of the semester, hoping for a relaxing break after exams and a summer of happy reunions with family in China’s far west.

香港——学生们在学期结束时订好了回家的机票，希望在考试结束后有一个轻松的休息时间，以及在中国西部与家人团聚的夏天。

Instead, they would soon be told that their parents were gone, relatives had vanished and neighbors were missing — all of them locked up in an expanding network of detention camps built to hold Muslim ethnic minorities.

相反，他们很快就会被告知，他们的父母已经去世，亲戚已经消失，邻居也失踪了ーー他们都被关在一个不断扩大的拘留营里，这些拘留营是为关押穆斯林少数民族而建的。

The authorities in the Xinjiang region worried the situation was a powder keg. And so they prepared.

新疆地区的当局担心形势会像火药桶一样，所以他们做好了准备。

The leadership distributed a classified directive advising local officials to corner returning students as soon as they arrived and keep them quiet. It included a chillingly bureaucratic guide for how to handle their anguished questions, beginning with the most obvious: Where is my family?

领导层分发了一份机密指令，建议当地官员在返乡学生到达后立即将其围困，并让他们保持安静。 它包括一个令人毛骨悚然的官僚指南，教你如何处理他们痛苦的问题，从最明显的开始: 我的家人在哪里？

“**They’re in a training school set up by the government,**” the prescribed answer began. If pressed, officials were to tell students that their relatives were not criminals — yet could not leave these “schools.” “他们在政府设立的培训学校里，”规定的回答开始了。 如果有人追问，官员会告诉学生，他们的亲戚不是罪犯，但是不能离开这些“学校”

The question-and-answer script also included a **barely concealed threat**: Students were to be told that their behavior could either shorten or extend the detention of their relatives. 这个问答式的脚本还包括一个几乎不加掩饰的威胁: 学生们被告知，他们的行为可能会缩短或延长对其亲属的拘留时间

“**I’m sure that you will support them, because this is for their own good,**” officials were advised to say, “**and also for your own good.**” “我相信你们会支持他们，因为这是为了他们好，”官员们被建议说，“也是为了你们好。”

​

The directive was among 403 pages of internal documents that have been shared with The New York Times in one of the most significant leaks of government papers from inside China’s ruling Communist Party in decades. They provide an unprecedented inside view of the [continuing clampdown in Xinjiang, in which the authorities have corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html) over the past three years.

这份指令是《纽约时报》分享的403页内部文件中的一份，这是数十年来中国执政党共产党内部泄露的最重要的政府文件之一。 他们提供了一个前所未有的新疆持续压制的内部视角，在过去三年里，当局把多达100万维吾尔族、哈萨克族和其他人关进了拘留营和监狱。

阅读完整文件: 中国官员告诉被关押家庭的孩子们什么

The party has [rejected international criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/china-xinjiang.html) that use mild methods to fight Islamic extremism. But the documents confirm the coercive nature of the crackdown in the words and orders of the very officials who conceived and orchestrated it.

该党拒绝了国际上对这些训练营的批评，并将它们描述为使用温和方法对抗伊斯兰极端主义组织的职业培训中心。 但是这些文件证实了这次镇压的强制性，就是那些策划和策划这次镇压的官员的言论和命令。

Even as the government presented its efforts in Xinjiang to the public as benevolent and unexceptional, it discussed and organized a ruthless and extraordinary campaign in these internal communications. Senior party leaders are recorded ordering drastic and urgent action against extremist violence, including the mass detentions, and discussing the consequences with cool detachment.

尽管政府将其在新疆的努力表现为仁慈和平凡，但在这些内部沟通中，政府讨论并组织了一场无情和非凡的运动。 据记录，党内高层领导人下令对极端主义暴力活动采取激烈和紧急的行动，包括大规模拘留，并与冷静的超然讨论后果。

Children saw their parents taken away, students wondered who would pay their tuition and crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of manpower, the reports noted. Yet officials were directed to tell people who complained to be grateful for the Communist Party’s help and stay quiet.

报告指出，孩子们看到他们的父母被带走，学生们想知道谁来支付他们的学费，由于缺乏人力，农作物无法种植或收获。 然而，官员们被指示告诉那些抱怨的人，要对共产党的帮助心存感激，并保持沉默。

The leaked papers offer a striking picture of how the hidden machinery of the Chinese state carried out the country’s most far-reaching internment campaign since the Mao era. The key disclosures in the documents include:

这些泄露的文件提供了一幅令人震惊的画面，展示了中国政府的隐形机器如何开展了自毛泽东时代以来影响最为深远的拘留行动。 这些文件的主要披露内容包括:

• President Xi Jinping, the party chief, laid the groundwork for the crackdown in a series of speeches delivered in private to officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang in April 2014, just weeks after Uighur militants [stabbed more than 150 people at a train station](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/asia/china-executes-3-over-deadly-knife-attack-at-train-station-in-2014.html), killing 31. Mr. Xi called for an all-out “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism” using the “organs of dictatorship,” and showing “absolutely no mercy.”

•在2014年4月访问新疆期间及之后，中共中央总书记习近平私下向官员发表了一系列讲话，为镇压行动奠定了基础。几周前，维吾尔族武装分子在一个火车站刺伤了150多人，导致31人死亡。 习呼吁利用“专政机关” ，全面开展“反恐、反渗透、反分裂”斗争，“绝不留情”

• Terrorist attacks abroad and the drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan heightened the leadership’s fears and helped shape the crackdown. Officials argued that attacks in Britain resulted from policies that put “human rights above security,” and Mr. Xi urged the party to emulate aspects of America’s “war on terror” after the Sept. 11 attacks.

•国外的恐怖袭击以及美军在阿富汗的撤离，加剧了领导层的担忧，并帮助塑造了镇压行动。 官员们辩称，英国发生的袭击事件源于“人权高于安全”的政策，习敦促党效仿9 · 11袭击后美国“反恐战争”的做法。

• The internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment in August 2016 of Chen Quanguo, a zealous new party boss for the region. He distributed Mr. Xi’s speeches to justify the campaign and exhorted officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up.”

•2016年8月，新疆党的新领导人陈全国被任命后，新疆的拘留营迅速扩大。 他分发了习的讲话，以证明这场运动的正当性，并劝告官员们“把所有应该抓的人都抓起来”

• The crackdown encountered doubts and resistance from local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth. Mr. Chen responded by purging officials suspected of standing in his way, including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps.

•镇压遭到了当地官员的怀疑和抵制，他们担心这会加剧民族紧张关系，扼杀经济增长。 作为回应，陈先生清除了一些涉嫌妨碍他的官员，其中包括一名县领导，他在悄悄地从集中营释放了数千名囚犯后被监禁。

The leaked papers consist of 24 documents, some of which contain duplicated material. They include nearly 200 pages of internal speeches by Mr. Xi and other leaders, and more than 150 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang. There are also references to plans to extend restrictions on Islam to other parts of China.

泄漏的文件包括24份文件，其中一些包含重复的材料。 其中包括习和其他领导人发表的近200页内部讲话，以及150多页关于监控和控制新疆维吾尔族人口的指令和报告。 还有人提到了将对伊斯兰教的限制扩大到中国其他地区的计划。

Though it is unclear how the documents were gathered and selected, the leak suggests greater discontent inside the party apparatus over the crackdown than previously known. The papers were brought to light by a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity and expressed hope that their disclosure would prevent party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions.

虽然目前尚不清楚这些文件是如何收集和挑选的，但泄露的文件表明，党内对镇压行动的不满情绪比先前知道的要强烈。 这些文件是由中国政治机构的一名成员曝光的，他要求匿名，并表示希望这些文件的披露能够防止包括习在内的党领导人逃脱大规模拘留的罪责。

The Chinese leadership wraps policymaking in secrecy, especially when it comes to Xinjiang, a resource-rich territory located on the sensitive frontier with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups make up more than half the region’s population of 25 million. The largest of these groups are the Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language and have long faced discrimination and restrictions on cultural and religious activities.

中国领导层对政策制定秘而不宣，尤其是在新疆问题上。新疆是一块资源丰富的领土，位于与巴基斯坦、阿富汗和中亚的敏感边境。 以穆斯林为主的少数民族占该地区2500万人口的一半以上。 其中最大的群体是维吾尔族人，他们讲突厥语系语言，长期以来在文化和宗教活动方面受到歧视和限制。

Beijing has sought for decades to suppress Uighur resistance to Chinese rule in Xinjiang. The current crackdown began after a surge of antigovernment and anti-Chinese violence, including [ethnic riots in 2009 in Urumqi](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/asia/18xinjiang.html), the regional capital, and a May 2014 [attack on an outdoor market that killed 39 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/world/asia/8-sentenced-to-death-for-terrorist-attacks-in-western-china.html) just days before Mr. Xi convened a leadership conference in Beijing to set a new policy course for Xinjiang.

几十年来，北京一直试图镇压维吾尔人对中国在新疆统治的抵抗。 当前的镇压始于反政府和反华暴力活动激增之后，包括2009年在新疆首府乌鲁木齐发生的民族骚乱，以及2014年5月在一个露天市场发生的袭击事件。就在几天后，习在北京召开领导人会议，为新疆制定新的政策方针。

Since 2017, the authorities in Xinjiang have detained many hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in internment camps. Inmates undergo months or years of indoctrination and interrogation aimed at transforming them into secular and loyal supporters of the party.

自2017年以来，新疆当局在拘留营中拘留了数十万维吾尔人、哈萨克人和其他穆斯林。 囚犯接受数月或数年的教化和审讯，目的是将他们转变为该党的世俗和忠实支持者。

Of the 24 documents, the directive on how to handle minority students returning home to Xinjiang in the summer of 2017 offers the most detailed discussion of the indoctrination camps — and the clearest illustration of the regimented way the party told the public one story while mobilizing around a much harsher narrative internally.

在这24份文件中，关于如何处理2017年夏天返回新疆的少数民族学生的指示对教化营进行了最为详细的讨论，也最清楚地说明了党在内部围绕一个更为严厉的叙事向公众讲述一个故事时的刻板方式。

Even as the document advises officials to inform students that their relatives are receiving “treatment” for exposure to radical Islam, its title refers to family members who are being “dealt with,” or chuzhi, a euphemism used in party documents to mean punishment.

尽管文件建议官员告知学生，他们的亲属因为接触激进的伊斯兰教而正在接受“治疗” ，但文件的标题指的是正在接受“处理”的家庭成员，或者“处处” ，这是党的文件中用来表示惩罚的委婉说法。

Officials in Turpan, a city in eastern Xinjiang, drafted the question-and-answer script after the regional government warned local officials to prepare for the returning students. The agency coordinating efforts to “maintain stability” across Xinjiang then distributed the guide across the region and urged officials to use it as a model.

新疆东部城市吐鲁番的官员起草了这份问答稿，此前当地政府警告当地官员要为回国学生做好准备。 该机构协调努力，在新疆各地“保持稳定” ，然后在整个地区分发指南，并敦促官员以此为榜样。

The government sends Xinjiang’s brightest young Uighurs to universities across China, with the goal of training a new generation of Uighur civil servants and teachers loyal to the party.

政府把新疆最聪明的维吾尔族青年送到中国各地的大学，目的是培养新一代的维吾尔族公务员和忠于党的教师。

The crackdown has been so extensive that it affected even these elite students, the directive shows. And that made the authorities nervous.

该指令显示，打击行动的范围非常广泛，甚至影响到了这些精英学生。 这让当局感到紧张。

“Returning students from other parts of China have widespread social ties across the entire country,” the directive noted. “The moment they issue incorrect opinions on WeChat, Weibo and other social media platforms, the impact is widespread and difficult to eradicate.”

“从中国其他地方回国的学生在整个国家有着广泛的社会联系，”该指令指出。 “一旦他们在微信、微博和其他社交媒体平台上发表不正确的言论，影响是广泛的，难以消除。”

The document warned that there was a “**serious possibility**” students might sink into “**turmoil**” after learning what had happened to their relatives. It recommended that police officers in plain clothes and experienced local officials meet them as soon as they returned “to show humane concern and stress the rules.” 这份文件警告说，学生们在得知自己的亲戚发生了什么事情后，“极有可能”陷入“混乱”。 它建议便衣警察和经验丰富的地方官员在他们一回来就与他们会面，”以表示人道关怀和强调规则”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc2-highlight-02.jpg)

The directive’s question-and-answer guide begins gently, with officials advised to tell the students that they have “**absolutely no need to worry**” about relatives who have disappeared. 该指示的问答指南开头语气温和，官员们建议学生们告诉他们，他们“绝对没有必要担心”失踪的亲属

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc2-highlight-03.jpg)

“**Tuition for their period of study is free and so are food and living costs, and the standards are quite high,**” officials were told to say, before adding that the authorities were spending more than $3 per day on meals for each detainee, “**even better than the living standards that some students have back home.**” “他们学习期间的学费是免费的，食物和生活费用也是免费的，而且标准相当高，”官员们被告知，然后又补充说，当局每天为每个被拘留者提供的膳食花费超过3美元，“甚至比一些学生回家后的生活水平还要高。”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc2-highlight-04.jpg)

“**If you want to see them,**” the answer concluded, “**we can arrange for you to have a video meeting.**” “如果你想见他们，”回答总结道，“我们可以安排你们进行视频会议。”

​

The authorities anticipated, however, that this was unlikely to mollify students and provided replies to a series of other questions: When will my relatives be released? If this is for training, why can’t they come home? Can they request a leave? How will I afford school if my parents are studying and there is no one to work on the farm?

然而，当局预计这不太可能安抚学生，并对一系列其他问题作出了答复: 我的亲属什么时候能获释？ 如果这是为了训练，为什么他们不能回家？ 他们可以请假吗？ 如果我的父母都在读书，没有人在农场工作，我怎么供得起学费？

The guide recommended increasingly firm replies telling the students that their relatives had been “infected” by the “virus” of Islamic radicalism and must be quarantined and cured. Even grandparents and family members who seemed too old to carry out violence could not be spared, officials were directed to say.

该指南建议学生们越来越坚定地回答，他们的亲属已经被伊斯兰激进主义的“病毒”“感染” ，必须被隔离和治愈。 官员们指示说，即使是那些看起来年龄太大而不能实施暴力的祖父母和家庭成员也不能幸免。

“If they don’t undergo study and training, they’ll never thoroughly and fully understand the dangers of religious extremism,” one answer said, citing the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State. “No matter what age, anyone who has been infected by religious extremism must undergo study.”

“如果他们不接受学习和训练，他们永远不会彻底、充分地了解宗教极端主义的危险，”一个答案说，并以叙利亚内战和伊斯兰国(Islamic State)的崛起为例。 “任何受到宗教极端主义影响的人，无论年龄大小，都必须接受教育。”

Students should be grateful that the authorities had taken their relatives away, the document said.

文件称，学生们应该感谢当局带走了他们的亲属。

“Treasure this chance for free education that the party and government has provided to thoroughly eradicate erroneous thinking, and also learn Chinese and job skills,” one answer said. “This offers a great foundation for a happy life for your family.”

“珍惜党和政府提供的这个免费教育的机会，彻底根除错误思想，还要学习中文和工作技能，”其中一个回答说。 “这为你的家庭幸福生活提供了很好的基础。”

The authorities appear to be using a scoring system to determine who can be released from the camps: The document instructed officials to tell the students that their behavior could hurt their relatives’ scores, and to assess the daily behavior of the students and record their attendance at training sessions, meetings and other activities.

当局似乎在使用一个评分系统来决定哪些人可以被释放: 文件指示官员告诉学生，他们的行为可能会影响亲属的分数，并评估学生的日常行为，记录他们参加培训、会议和其他活动的情况。

“**Family members, including you, must abide by the state’s laws and rules, and not believe or spread rumors,**” officials were told to say. “**Only then can you add points for your family member, and after a period of assessment they can leave the school if they meet course completion standards.**” 官员们被告知: “包括你在内的家庭成员必须遵守国家的法律和规定，不能相信或散布谣言。”。 “只有这样，你才能为你的家庭成员加分，经过一段时间的评估，如果他们达到课程完成标准，他们就可以离开学校。”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc3-highlight-02.jpg)

If asked about the impact of the detentions on family finances, officials were advised to assure students that “**the party and the government will do everything possible to ease your hardships.**” 如果被问及拘留对家庭财务的影响，官员们被建议向学生保证，“党和政府将尽一切可能减轻你们的苦难。”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc3-highlight-03.jpg)

The line that stands out most in the script, however, may be the model answer for how to respond to students who ask of their detained relatives, “**Did they commit a crime?**” 然而，剧本中最引人注目的一句台词，可能是学生们询问被拘留亲属“他们犯罪了吗? ”时，如何回答这个问题的模范答案

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc3-highlight-04.jpg)

The document instructed officials to acknowledge that they had not. “**It is just that their thinking has been infected by unhealthy thoughts,**” the script said. 这份文件要求官员们承认他们没有。 “只是他们的思想受到了不健康思想的影响，”剧本说

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc3-highlight-05.jpg)

“**Freedom is only possible when this ‘virus’ in their thinking is eradicated and they are in good health.**” “只有当他们思想中的这种‘病毒'被根除，他们的健康状况良好时，自由才有可能。”

​

The ideas driving the mass detentions can be traced back to Xi Jinping’s first and only visit to Xinjiang as China’s leader, a tour shadowed by violence.

驱动大规模拘留的想法可以追溯到习近平作为中国领导人第一次也是唯一一次访问新疆，这次访问被暴力笼罩着。

In 2014, little more than a year after becoming president, he spent four days in the region, and on the last day of the trip, two Uighur militants staged a suicide bombing outside a train station in Urumqi that injured nearly 80 people, one fatally.

2014年，也就是他成为总统一年多后，他在新疆停留了四天。在行程的最后一天，两名维吾尔族武装分子在乌鲁木齐的一个火车站外制造了一起自杀式爆炸，导致近80人受伤，其中一人死亡。

Weeks earlier, militants with knives had gone on a rampage at another railway station, in southwest China, killing 31 people and injuring more than 140. And less than a month after Mr. Xi’s visit, assailants tossed explosives into a vegetable market in Urumqi, wounding 94 people and killing at least 39.

几周前，持刀武装分子在中国西南部的另一个火车站横冲直撞，造成31人死亡，140多人受伤。 在习访问乌鲁木齐不到一个月后，袭击者向乌鲁木齐的一个菜市场投掷爆炸物，导致94人受伤，至少39人死亡。

Against this backdrop of bloodshed, Mr. Xi delivered a series of secret speeches setting the hard-line course that culminated in the security offensive now underway in Xinjiang. While state media have alluded to these speeches, none were made public.

在这种流血冲突的背景下，习发表了一系列秘密讲话，确定了强硬路线，最终导致了目前正在新疆展开的安全攻势。 尽管官方媒体间接提到了这些演讲，但没有一个演讲是公开的。

The text of four of them, though, were among the leaked documents — and they provide a rare, unfiltered look at the origins of the crackdown and the beliefs of the man who set it in motion.

不过，其中四份文件的文本也在泄露的文件之列。这些文件罕见地、未经过滤地展示了镇压行动的起源，以及发动镇压行动的人的信仰。

“The methods that our comrades have at hand are too primitive,” Mr. Xi said in one talk, after inspecting a counterterrorism police squad in Urumqi. “None of these weapons is any answer for their big machete blades, ax heads and cold steel weapons.”

习在视察乌鲁木齐的一支反恐警察队伍后，在一次谈话中说，“我们同志手头的方法太原始了。”。 “所有这些武器都不能解释他们的大砍刀刀刃、斧头和冷钢武器。”

“We must be as harsh as them,” he added, “and show absolutely no mercy.”

“我们必须像他们一样严厉，”他补充说，“绝对不能手下留情。”

In free-flowing monologues in Xinjiang and at a subsequent leadership conference on Xinjiang policy in Beijing, Mr. Xi is recorded thinking through what he called a crucial national security issue and laying out his ideas for a “people’s war” in the region.

在新疆自由发表的独白中，以及随后在北京举行的新疆政策领导人会议上，记录显示，习思考了他所说的一个关键的国家安全问题，并阐述了他对新疆“人民战争”的想法。

Although he did not order mass detentions in these speeches, he called on the party to unleash the tools of “dictatorship” to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.

尽管他在这些讲话中没有下令大规模拘留，但他呼吁中共释放“独裁”的工具，在新疆铲除伊斯兰激进分子。

Mr. Xi displayed a fixation with the issue that seemed to go well beyond his public remarks on the subject. He likened Islamic extremism alternately to a virus-like contagion and a dangerously addictive drug, and declared that addressing it would require “a period of painful, interventionary treatment.”

习对这个问题的关注似乎远远超出了他在这个问题上的公开言论。 他把伊斯兰极端主义交替地比作类似病毒的传染病和危险的成瘾药物，并宣称解决这个问题需要“一段痛苦的干预治疗期”

“The psychological impact of extremist religious thought on people must never be underestimated,” Mr. Xi told officials in Urumqi on April 30, 2014, the final day of his trip to Xinjiang. “People who are captured by religious extremism — male or female, old or young — have their consciences destroyed, lose their humanity and murder without blinking an eye.”

2014年4月30日，也就是习访问新疆的最后一天，习在乌鲁木齐对官员们说，“决不能低估极端宗教思想对人们的心理影响。”。 “那些被宗教极端主义俘虏的人——无论男女老幼——他们的良心被摧毁，人性被丧失，谋杀却眼都不眨一下。”

In another speech, at the leadership conclave in Beijing a month later, he warned of “the toxicity of religious extremism.”

一个月后，在北京的领导人秘密会议上，他发表了另一次讲话，警告“宗教极端主义的毒性”

“As soon as you believe in it,” he said, “it’s like taking a drug, and you lose your sense, go crazy and will do anything.”

“一旦你相信了它，”他说，“就像服用了一种药物，你失去了理智，变得疯狂，什么都愿意做。”

In several surprising passages, given the crackdown that followed, Mr. Xi also told officials to not discriminate against Uighurs and to respect their right to worship. He warned against overreacting to natural friction between Uighurs and Han Chinese, the nation’s dominant ethnic group, and rejected proposals to try to eliminate Islam entirely in China.

考虑到随后的镇压行动，习还在几段出人意料的讲话中告诉官员，不要歧视维吾尔族人，尊重他们的信仰权。 他警告说，不要对维族人和汉族人之间的自然摩擦反应过度，并拒绝了试图在中国完全消灭伊斯兰教的提议。

“In light of separatist and terrorist forces under the banner of Islam, some people have argued that Islam should be restricted or even eradicated,” he said during the Beijing conference. He called that view “biased, even wrong.”

“鉴于伊斯兰旗帜下的分裂主义和恐怖主义势力，一些人认为应该限制甚至根除伊斯兰教，”他在北京会议期间表示。 他称这种观点是“有偏见的，甚至是错误的”

But Mr. Xi’s main point was unmistakable: He was leading the party in a sharp turn toward greater repression in Xinjiang.

但是习的主要观点是明确无误的: 他正在领导党朝着加强新疆镇压的方向急转弯。

Before Mr. Xi, the party had often described attacks in Xinjiang as the work of a few fanatics inspired and orchestrated by shadowy separatist groups abroad. But Mr. Xi argued that Islamic extremism had taken root across swaths of Uighur society.

在习之前，中共经常将新疆的袭击事件描述为由海外阴暗的分裂主义团体鼓动和精心策划的少数狂热分子所为。 但习认为，伊斯兰极端主义已经在维吾尔社会的很多地方扎下了根。

In fact, the vast majority of Uighurs adhere to moderate traditions, though some began embracing more conservative and more public religious practices in the 1990s, despite state controls on Islam. Mr. Xi’s remarks suggest he was alarmed by the revival of public piety. He blamed lax controls on religion, suggesting that his predecessors had let down their guard.

事实上，绝大多数维吾尔族人都遵循温和的传统，尽管一些人在20世纪90年代开始接受更保守、更公开的宗教活动，尽管国家对伊斯兰教有所控制。 习的言论似乎表明，他对公众虔诚的复苏感到担忧。 他将管制松懈归咎于宗教，暗示他的前任们已经放松了警惕。

While previous Chinese leaders emphasized economic development to stifle unrest in Xinjiang, Mr. Xi said that was not enough. He demanded an ideological cure, an effort to rewire the thinking of the region’s Muslim minorities.

尽管以前的中国领导人强调经济发展，以遏制新疆的骚乱，但习表示，这还不够。 他要求进行意识形态治疗，努力重新调整该地区穆斯林少数民族的思想。

“The weapons of the people’s democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering,” Mr. Xi told the leadership conference on Xinjiang policy, which convened six days after the deadly attack on the vegetable market.

“人民民主专政的武器必须毫不犹豫、毫不动摇地使用，”习在新疆政策领导人会议上说。这次会议是在蔬菜市场遭到致命打击的六天后召开的。

Mr. Xi is the [son of an early Communist Party leader](https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/china-venerates-a-revolutionary-the-father-of-its-new-leader/) who in the 1980s supported more relaxed policies toward ethnic minority groups, and some analysts had expected he might follow his father’s milder ways when he [assumed leadership of the party in November 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/asia/communists-conclude-party-congress-in-china.html).

习近平是一位早期共产党领导人的儿子，他在20世纪80年代支持对少数民族采取更宽松的政策，一些分析人士曾预计，习近平在2012年11月接任党的领导职务时，可能会效仿他父亲的温和做法。

But the speeches underscore how Mr. Xi sees risks to China through the prism of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he blamed on ideological laxity and spineless leadership.

但是，这些讲话突显了习如何通过苏联解体的棱镜来看待中国面临的风险。他将苏联解体归咎于意识形态的松懈和懦弱的领导层。

Across China, he set about eliminating challenges to party rule; dissidents and [human rights lawyers disappeared in waves of arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/world/asia/china-wang-quanzhang-human-rights.html). In Xinjiang, he pointed to examples from the former Soviet bloc to argue that economic growth would not immunize a society against ethnic separatism.

在中国各地，他着手消除对党统治的挑战; 持不同政见者和人权律师在一波又一波的逮捕中消失。 在新疆，他举出前苏联集团的例子，认为经济增长不会使一个社会免于民族分离主义。

The Baltic republics were among the most developed in the Soviet Union but also the first to leave when the country broke up, he told the leadership conference. Yugoslavia’s relative prosperity did not prevent its disintegration either, he added.

他在领导人会议上表示，波罗的海共和国是苏联最发达的国家之一，但也是苏联解体后最先离开的国家。 他补充说，南斯拉夫的相对繁荣也没能阻止它的解体。

“We say that development is the top priority and the basis for achieving lasting security, and that’s right,” Mr. Xi said. “But it would be wrong to believe that with development every problem solves itself.”

“我们说，发展是第一要务，是实现持久安全的基础，这是对的，”习说。 “但如果认为，随着发展，每个问题都会自行解决，那就错了。”

In the speeches, Mr. Xi showed a deep familiarity with the history of Uighur resistance to Chinese rule, or at least Beijing’s official version of it, and discussed episodes rarely if ever mentioned by Chinese leaders in public, including brief periods of Uighur self-rule in the first half of the 20th century.

在讲话中，习对维吾尔人反抗中国统治的历史，或者至少是北京官方版本的历史，表现出了深刻的了解。他还谈到了中国领导人很少公开提及的一些事件，包括20世纪上半叶维吾尔人短暂的自治时期。

Violence by Uighur militants has never threatened Communist control of the region. Though attacks grew deadlier after 2009, when nearly 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, they remained relatively small, scattered and unsophisticated.

维吾尔激进分子的暴力活动从未威胁到共产党对该地区的控制。 2009年乌鲁木齐发生的民族骚乱导致近200人死亡，尽管袭击事件的杀伤力有所增加，但仍然相对较小，分散，不成熟。

Even so, Mr. Xi warned that the violence was spilling from Xinjiang into other parts of China and could taint the party’s image of strength. Unless the threat was extinguished, Mr. Xi told the leadership conference, “social stability will suffer shocks, the general unity of people of every ethnicity will be damaged, and the broad outlook for reform, development and stability will be affected.”

尽管如此，习警告说，暴力活动正从新疆蔓延到中国其他地区，可能会损害党的实力形象。 习在领导人会议上表示，除非威胁被消除，否则“社会稳定将受到冲击，各族人民的普遍团结将受到破坏，改革、发展和稳定的广阔前景将受到影响。”

Setting aside diplomatic niceties, he traced the origins of Islamic extremism in Xinjiang to the Middle East, and warned that turmoil in Syria and Afghanistan would magnify the risks for China. Uighurs had traveled to both countries, he said, and could return to China as seasoned fighters seeking an independent homeland, which they called East Turkestan.

撇开外交礼节不谈，他将新疆伊斯兰极端主义组织的起源追溯到中东，并警告说，叙利亚和阿富汗的动荡将放大中国面临的风险。 他说，维吾尔人去过这两个国家，可以作为经验丰富的战士回到中国，寻求一个独立的家园，他们称之为东突厥斯坦。

“After the United States pulls troops out of Afghanistan, terrorist organizations positioned on the frontiers of Afghanistan and Pakistan may quickly infiltrate into Central Asia,” Mr. Xi said. “East Turkestan’s terrorists who have received real-war training in Syria and Afghanistan could at any time launch terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.”

“美国从阿富汗撤军后，驻扎在阿富汗和巴基斯坦边境的恐怖组织可能会迅速渗透到中亚，”习说。 “在叙利亚和阿富汗接受过实战训练的东突恐怖分子随时可能在新疆发动恐怖袭击。”

Mr. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, responded to the 2009 riots in Urumqi with a clampdown but he also stressed economic development as a cure for ethnic discontent — longstanding party policy. But Mr. Xi signaled a break with Mr. Hu’s approach in the speeches.

习的前任胡锦涛对2009年乌鲁木齐骚乱的反应是镇压，但他也强调经济发展是解决民族不满的良方ーー这是党长期以来的政策。 但是习在讲话中表示要打破胡主席的做法。

“In recent years, Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise,” he said. “This goes to show that economic development does not automatically bring lasting order and security.”

他说，“近年来，新疆发展很快，人民生活水平不断提高，但民族分裂主义和恐怖主义暴力活动仍在增加。”。 “这表明，经济发展不会自动带来持久的秩序和安全。”

Ensuring stability in Xinjiang would require a sweeping campaign of surveillance and intelligence gathering to root out resistance in Uighur society, Mr. Xi argued.

习认为，要确保新疆的稳定，就需要开展大规模的监视和情报收集活动，以根除维吾尔社会的抵制。

He said new technology must be part of the solution, foreshadowing the party’s deployment of facial recognition, genetic testing and big data in Xinjiang. But he also emphasized old-fashioned methods, such as neighborhood informants, and urged officials to study how Americans responded to the Sept. 11 attacks.

他说，新技术必须是解决方案的一部分，这预示着党在新疆部署人脸识别、基因测试和大数据。 但他也强调老式的方法，比如向邻居告密，并敦促官员研究美国人对9 · 11袭击的反应。

Like the United States, he said, China “must make the public an important resource in protecting national security.”

他说，像美国一样，中国“必须让公众成为保护国家安全的重要资源”

“We Communists should be naturals at fighting a people’s war,” he said. “We’re the best at organizing for a task.”

“我们共产党人应该是打人民战争的天才，”他说。 “我们最擅长组织任务。”

The only suggestion in these speeches that Mr. Xi envisioned the internment camps now at the heart of the crackdown was an endorsement of more intense indoctrination programs in Xinjiang’s prisons.

在这些讲话中，习设想的处于打击行动核心的拘留营只是对新疆监狱开展更加密集的教化项目的认可。

“There must be effective educational remolding and transformation of criminals,” he told officials in southern Xinjiang on the second day of his trip. “And even after these people are released, their education and transformation must continue.”

“必须对罪犯进行有效的教育改造和转化，”他在行程的第二天对新疆南部的官员说。 “即使这些人被释放，他们的教育和改造也必须继续。”

Within months, indoctrination sites began opening across Xinjiang — mostly small facilities at first, which held dozens or hundreds of Uighurs at a time for sessions intended to pressure them into disavowing devotion to Islam and professing gratitude for the party.

几个月之内，新疆各地的教化网站开始开放，最初大多是小型设施，每次开会时，都会有数十或数百名维吾尔人参加，目的是迫使他们否认对伊斯兰教的忠诚，并对党表示感激。

Then in August 2016, a hard-liner named Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to govern Xinjiang. Within weeks, he called on local officials to “remobilize” around Mr. Xi’s goals and declared that Mr. Xi’s speeches “set the direction for making a success of Xinjiang.”

2016年8月，强硬派人物陈全国从西藏调到新疆。 几周之内，他呼吁地方官员围绕习的目标“重新调动” ，并宣称习的讲话“为新疆的成功确定了方向”

New security controls and a drastic expansion of the indoctrination camps followed.

随之而来的是新的安全控制和教化营的急剧扩张。

“**The struggle against terror and to safeguard stability is a protracted war, and also a war of offense,**” Mr. Chen said in a speech to the regional leadership in October 2017 that was among the leaked papers. “反恐和维护稳定的斗争是一场旷日持久的战争，也是一场进攻战争，”陈先生在2017年10月对地区领导层的演讲中说。这次演讲也是泄露的文件之一

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc4-highlight-02.jpg)

In another document, a record of his remarks in a video conference in August 2017, he cited “**vocational skills, education training and transformation centers**” as an example of “**good practices**” for achieving Mr. Xi’s goals for Xinjiang. 在另一份文件中，他引用了“职业技能、教育培训和转型中心”作为实现习新疆目标的“良好做法”。这份文件记录了他在2017年8月的一次视频会议上的讲话

​

The crackdown appears to have smothered violent unrest in Xinjiang, but many experts have warned that the extreme security measures and mass detentions are likely to breed resentment that could eventually inspire worse ethnic clashes.

镇压行动似乎平息了新疆的暴力骚乱，但许多专家警告称，极端的安全措施和大规模拘留可能会引发怨恨情绪，最终可能引发更严重的民族冲突。

The camps have been condemned in Washington and other foreign capitals. As early as the May 2014 leadership conference, though, Mr. Xi anticipated international criticism and urged officials behind closed doors to ignore it.

这些难民营在华盛顿和其他外国首都遭到谴责。 不过，早在2014年5月的领导人会议上，习就预料到了国际社会的批评，并且在闭门会议上敦促官员们无视这些批评。

“Don’t be afraid if hostile forces whine, or if hostile forces malign the image of Xinjiang,” he said.

“如果敌对势力发牢骚，或者敌对势力破坏新疆的形象，不要害怕，”他说。

The documents show there was more resistance to the crackdown inside the party than previously known — and highlight the key role that the new party boss in Xinjiang played in overcoming it.

这些文件显示，党内对镇压行动的抵制程度超过了此前所知的程度，并突显了新疆党委书记在克服这种抵制方面所发挥的关键作用。

Mr. Chen led a campaign akin to one of Mao’s turbulent political crusades, in which top-down pressure on local officials encouraged overreach and any expression of doubt was treated as a crime.

陈先生领导的竞选活动类似于毛动荡的政治改革运动，在这场运动中，自上而下对地方官员施加压力，鼓励过度干预，任何表示怀疑的行为都被视为犯罪。

In February 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at attention in a vast square in Urumqi to prepare for a “smashing, obliterating offensive.” In the following weeks, the documents indicate, the leadership settled on plans to detain Uighurs in large numbers.

2017年2月，他告诉在乌鲁木齐一个巨大的广场上立正的数千名警察和部队，准备“粉碎、消灭进攻” 文件显示，在接下来的几周里，领导层决定了大量拘留维族人的计划。

Mr. Chen issued a sweeping order: “Round up everyone who should be rounded up.” The vague phrase appears repeatedly in internal documents from 2017.

陈先生下达了一道彻底的命令: “把所有该抓的人都抓起来。” 这个模糊的短语在2017年的内部文件中反复出现。

The party had previously used the phrase — “ying shou jin shou” in Chinese — when demanding that officials be vigilant and comprehensive in collecting taxes or measuring harvests. Now it was being applied to humans in directives that ordered, with no mention of judicial procedures, the detention of anyone who displayed “symptoms” of religious radicalism or antigovernment views.

党以前在要求官员们在征税或计量收成时要保持警惕和全面性时，曾使用过“应守今守”这个词。 现在，这项规定在指令中被用于人类，指令下令拘留任何表现出宗教激进主义或反政府观点”症状”的人，但没有提及司法程序。

The authorities laid out dozens of such signs, including common behavior among devout Uighurs such as wearing long beards, giving up smoking or drinking, studying Arabic and praying outside mosques.

当局设置了数十个这样的标志，包括虔诚的维吾尔族人的常见行为，比如留长胡子、戒烟戒酒、学习阿拉伯语和在清真寺外祈祷。

Party leaders reinforced the orders with warnings about terrorism abroad and potential copycat attacks in China.

党的领导人加强了这些命令，警告国外的恐怖主义和中国可能出现的类似袭击。

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc5-highlight-01.jpg)

For example, a 10-page directive in June 2017 signed by Zhu Hailun, then Xinjiang’s top security official, called recent terrorist attacks in Britain “**a warning and a lesson for us.**” It blamed the British government’s “excessive emphasis on ‘human rights above security,’ and inadequate controls on the propagation of extremism on the internet and in society.” 例如，2017年6月，时任新疆最高安全官员的朱海伦签署了一份长达10页的指示，称最近英国发生的恐怖袭击是“对我们的警告和教训” 报告指责英国政府“过分强调‘人权高于安全'，对极端主义在互联网和社会上的传播控制不力。”

It also complained of security lapses in Xinjiang, including sloppy investigations, malfunctions in surveillance equipment and the failure to hold people accused of suspicious behavior. 它还抱怨新疆的安全漏洞，包括调查不力、监控设备出现故障，以及未能拘留被指有可疑行为的人

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/12bdb639232bd6e26a5ce4e03373e3c3fbd78994/doc5-highlight-03.jpg)

Keep up the detentions, it ordered. “**Stick to rounding up everyone who should be rounded up,**” it said. “**If they’re there, round them up.**” 中国政府下令继续拘留。 “坚持围捕每一个应该被围捕的人，”它说。 “如果他们在那里，就把他们围起来。”

​

The number of people swept into the camps remains a closely guarded secret. But one of the leaked documents offers a hint of the scale of the campaign: It instructed officials to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in crowded facilities.

进入集中营的人数仍然是一个严格保密的秘密。 但是其中一份泄露的文件暗示了这场运动的规模: 它指示官员在拥挤的设施中阻止传染病的扩散。

The orders were especially urgent and contentious in Yarkand County, a collection of rural towns and villages in southern Xinjiang where nearly all of the 900,000 residents are Uighur.

这些命令在 Yarkand County 尤其紧迫，也引起了争议。新疆南部是一些农村村镇，那里的90万居民几乎都是维吾尔族。

In the 2014 speeches, Mr. Xi had singled out southern Xinjiang as the front line in his fight against religious extremism. Uighurs make up close to 90 percent of the population in the south, compared to just under half in Xinjiang over all, and Mr. Xi set a long-term goal of attracting more Han Chinese settlers.

在2014年的讲话中，习把南疆作为打击宗教极端主义的前线。 维吾尔族人占南方人口的近90% ，而新疆总人口不到一半。习制定了一个长期目标，吸引更多汉族定居者。

He and other party leaders ordered a quasi-military organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to accelerate efforts to settle the area with more Han Chinese, the documents show.

文件显示，他和其他党的领导人下令成立一个准军事组织---- 新疆生产建设兵团，以加快努力，让更多的汉族人定居该地区。

A few months later, more than 100 Uighur militants armed with axes and knives [attacked a government office and police station in Yarkand](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/asia/china-says-nearly-100-are-killed-in-week-of-unrest-in-xinjiang.html), killing 37 people, according to government reports. In the battle, the security forces shot dead 59 assailants, the reports said.

据政府报道，几个月后，100多名维吾尔族武装分子携带斧头和刀具袭击了 Yarkand 的一个政府办公室和派出所，造成37人死亡。 报道称，在战斗中，安全部队击毙了59名袭击者。

An official named Wang Yongzhi was appointed to run Yarkand soon afterward. With his glasses and crew cut, he looked the picture of a party technocrat. He had grown up and spent his career in southern Xinjiang and was seen as a deft, seasoned official who could deliver on the party’s top priorities in the area: economic development and firm control of the Uighurs.

此后不久，一位名叫王永志的官员被任命管理莎车。 戴着眼镜，留着平头，他看上去像一个政党技术官僚。 他在新疆南部长大，并在那里度过了他的职业生涯。人们认为，他是一位机敏老练的官员，能够实现党在该地区的首要任务: 经济发展和对维吾尔人的严格控制。

But among the most revealing documents in the leaked papers are two that describe Mr. Wang’s downfall — an 11-page report summarizing the party’s internal investigation into his actions, and the text of a 15-page confession that he may have given under duress. Both were distributed inside the party as a warning to officials to fall in line behind the crackdown.

但在泄露的文件中，最具揭露性的文件包括两份描述王倒台的文件: 一份长达11页的报告，总结了党对其行为的内部调查，还有一份长达15页的供词，这份供词可能是在胁迫下提供的。 这两张照片都是在党内分发的，以警告官员们要站在镇压的后面。

Han officials like Mr. Wang serve as the party’s anchors in southern Xinjiang, watching over Uighur officials in more junior positions, and he seemed to enjoy the blessing of top leaders, including Yu Zhengsheng, then China’s most senior official for ethnic issues, who visited the county in 2015.

像王先生这样的汉族官员在新疆南部担任党的主持人，监视着处于较低职位的维吾尔族官员，他似乎得到了最高领导人的祝福，其中包括2015年访问该县的时任中国民族问题最高官员俞正声。

Mr. Wang set about beefing up security in Yarkand but he also pushed economic development to address ethnic discontent. And he sought to soften the party’s religious policies, declaring that there was nothing wrong with having a Quran at home and encouraging party officials to read it to better understand Uighur traditions.

王先生着手加强 Yarkand 的安全，但他也推动经济发展以解决民族不满。 他还试图软化党的宗教政策，宣称在家里放一本古兰经没有什么错，并鼓励党的官员阅读古兰经，以便更好地了解维吾尔族的传统。

When the mass detentions began, Mr. Wang did as he was told at first and appeared to embrace the task with zeal.

当大规模拘留开始时，王先生按照最初告诉他的做了，而且似乎热情地接受了这项任务。

He built two sprawling new detention facilities, including one as big as 50 basketball courts, and herded 20,000 people into them.

他建造了两个庞大的新拘留设施，其中包括一个有50个篮球场那么大的拘留设施，并将2万人聚集在那里。

He sharply increased funding for the security forces in 2017, more than doubling spending on outlays such as checkpoints and surveillance to 1.37 billion renminbi, or about $180 million.

2017年，他大幅增加了对安全部队的资金投入，将检查站和监控等支出增加了一倍多，达到13.7亿元人民币，约合1.8亿美元。

And he lined up party members for a rally in a public square and urged them to press the fight against terrorists. “Wipe them out completely,” he said. “Destroy them root and branch.”

他召集党员在公共广场集会，敦促他们加紧打击恐怖分子。 “彻底消灭他们，”他说。 “彻底摧毁他们。”

But privately, Mr. Wang had misgivings, according to the confession that he later signed, which would have been carefully vetted by the party.

但是私下里，根据王先生后来签署的供词，他有些疑虑，这份供词会被党仔细审查。

He was under intense pressure to prevent an outburst of violence in Yarkand, and worried the crackdown would provoke a backlash.

他承受着阻止 Yarkand 爆发暴力冲突的巨大压力，并担心镇压行动会引发反弹。

The authorities set numeric targets for Uighur detentions in parts of Xinjiang, and while it is unclear if they did so in Yarkand, Mr. Wang felt the orders left no room for moderation and would poison ethnic relations in the county.

当局为在新疆部分地区拘留维吾尔族人设定了数字目标，虽然不清楚他们是否在 Yarkand 这样做，但王先生认为这些命令没有留下任何缓和的余地，并将毒化该县的民族关系。

He also worried that the mass detentions would make it impossible to record the economic progress he needed to earn a promotion.

他还担心，大规模的拘留将使他无法记录他获得晋升所需的经济进展。

The leadership had set goals to reduce poverty in Xinjiang. But with so many working-age residents being sent to the camps, Mr. Wang was afraid the targets would be out of reach, along with his hopes for a better job.

领导层已经制定了减少新疆贫困的目标。 但是，由于有这么多处于工作年龄的居民被送到难民营，王先生担心这些目标可能遥不可及，同时他也希望能找到一份更好的工作。

His superiors, he wrote, were “overly ambitious and unrealistic.”

他写道，他的上司“过于雄心勃勃，不切实际”

“The policies and measures taken by higher levels were at gaping odds with realities on the ground and could not be implemented in full,” he added.

“上级采取的政策和措施与实际情况不符，不能全面执行，”他补充说。

To help enforce the crackdown in southern Xinjiang, Mr. Chen transferred in hundreds of officials from the north. Publicly, Mr. Wang welcomed the 62 assigned to Yarkand. Privately, he seethed that they did not understand how to work with local officials and residents.

为了帮助加强在南疆的镇压，陈先生从北方调来了数百名官员。 在公开场合，王先生对分配到 Yarkand 的62人表示欢迎。 私下里，他愤怒地表示，他们不懂得如何与当地官员和居民合作。

The pressure on officials in Xinjiang to detain Uighurs and prevent fresh violence was relentless, and Mr. Wang said in the confession — presumably signed under pressure — that he drank on the job. He described one episode in which he collapsed drunk during a meeting on security.

要求新疆官员拘留维吾尔族人并防止新的暴力事件发生的压力是无情的，王先生在认罪书中说，他在工作时喝酒。据推测，他是在压力下签署认罪书的。 他描述了一次他在一次安全会议上醉倒的情形。

“While reporting on my work in the afternoon meeting, I rambled incoherently,” he said. “I’d just spoken a few sentences and my head collapsed on the table. It became the biggest joke across the whole prefecture.”

“在下午的会议上报道我的工作时，我语无伦次，”他说。 “我只说了几句话，头就倒在了桌子上。 这成了全县最大的笑话。”

Thousands of officials in Xinjiang were punished for resisting or failing to carry out the crackdown with sufficient zeal. Uighur officials were accused of protecting fellow Uighurs, and Gu Wensheng, the Han leader of another southern county, was jailed for trying to slow the detentions and shield Uighur officials, according to the documents.

成千上万的新疆官员因为抵制或没有以足够的热情开展打击行动而受到惩罚。 文件显示，维吾尔族官员被指控保护维吾尔族同胞，而另一个南方县的汉族领导人谷文生则因试图减缓拘留和庇护维吾尔族官员而被判入狱。

Secret teams of investigators traveled across the region identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang for infractions in the “fight against separatism,” more than 20 times the figure in the previous year, according to official statistics.

秘密调查小组遍布整个地区，确认那些做得不够的人。 根据官方统计数据，2017年，党对新疆党员违反“反分裂主义”的行为展开了1.2万多项调查，是前一年的20多倍。

Mr. Wang may have gone further than any other official.

王先生可能比任何其他官员走得更远。

Quietly, he ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates — an act of defiance for which he would be detained, stripped of power and prosecuted.

他悄悄下令释放7000多名集中营犯人，这是一种挑衅行为，他将因此被拘留、剥夺权力并受到起诉。

“**I undercut, acted selectively and made my own adjustments, believing that rounding up so many people would knowingly fan conflict and deepen resentment**,” Mr. Wang wrote. 王先生写道: “我削弱、选择性地采取行动，并做出了自己的调整，我相信围捕这么多人会明知故犯地煽动冲突，加深怨恨。”

“**Without approval and on my own initiative**,” he added, “**I broke the rules.**” “没有得到批准，也是我自己主动的，”他补充说，“我违反了规定。”

​

Mr. Wang quietly disappeared from public view after September 2017.

2017年9月之后，王先生悄悄地从公众视野中消失了。

About six months later, the party made an example of him, announcing that he was being investigated for “gravely disobeying the party central leadership’s strategy for governing Xinjiang.”

大约六个月后，中共以他为榜样，宣布他因“严重违背党中央领导的新疆治理战略”正在接受调查

The internal report on the investigation was more direct. “He should have given his all to serving the party,” it said. “Instead, he ignored the party central leadership’s strategy for Xinjiang, and he went as far as brazen defiance.”

调查的内部报告更加直接。 “他应该全力以赴为党服务，”文章称。 “相反，他无视党中央对新疆的战略，甚至公然挑衅。”

Both the report and Mr. Wang’s confession were read aloud to officials across Xinjiang. The message was plain: The party would not tolerate any hesitation in carrying out the mass detentions.

这份报告和王先生的供词都被大声读给新疆各地的官员听。 信息很明确: 党不会容忍任何犹豫执行大规模拘留。

Propaganda outlets described Mr. Wang as irredeemably corrupt, and the internal report accused him of taking bribes on construction and mining deals and paying off superiors to win promotions.

宣传机构将王先生描述为无可救药的腐败，内部报告指控他在建筑和采矿交易中收受贿赂，贿赂上级以获得晋升。

The authorities also emphasized he was no friend of Uighurs. To hit poverty-reduction targets, he was said to have forced 1,500 families to move into unheated apartments in the middle of the winter. Some villagers burned wood indoors to keep warm, leading to injuries and deaths, his confession said.

当局还强调他不是维吾尔人的朋友。 据说，为了实现减贫目标，他在隆冬时节强迫1500个家庭搬进了没有暖气的公寓。 他在供词中说，一些村民在室内烧木头取暖，导致人员伤亡。

But Mr. Wang’s greatest political sin was not revealed to the public. Instead, the authorities hid it in the internal report.

但是王先生最大的政治罪过并没有公之于众。 相反，当局将其隐藏在内部报告中。

“He refused,” it said, “to round up everyone who should be rounded up.”

“他拒绝，”文章写道，“把所有应该被围捕的人都抓起来。”
